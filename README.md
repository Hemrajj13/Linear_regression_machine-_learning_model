# Linear_regression_machine-_learning_model


This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating an end-to-end implementation of a Linear Regression machine learning model.

The notebook covers:
- Understanding the problem statement and dataset
- Data preprocessing and feature preparation
- Building a Linear Regression model
- Model training and prediction
- Evaluating model performance

The emphasis is on clarity, intuition, and practical understanding rather than treating the model as a black box.

This notebook is ideal for:
- Beginners learning machine learning
- Students and career switchers
- Practitioners revisiting linear regression concepts
